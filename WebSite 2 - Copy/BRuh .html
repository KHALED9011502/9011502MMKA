    <h1><big>What is C#?</big></h1>
    
    <p>C# is a program for multi uses like gaming with the engine unity or making a .Net Fiddle,</p>
    <p>Now you might think its hard, like what most people say,  it's very easy if you learn the basic's of c# the rest will be much easier to learn</p>   
    <p>I know C# pretty well, if you want to try it out check this video by <ins>"Bro code"</ins></p>

     <p>C# is one of the best Programming language's out their, that's easy and great for you and other's</p>
     <p>Mostly used for .Net Fiddle's and Websites, all though, HTML CSS JAVASCRIPT are much better in my opinion, they are fully made for websites like these, </p>
